  "About": {
    "summary": "Established in 2020, my entrepreneurial journey began with a curiosity for fruit carving, evolving seamlessly into crafting exquisite fruit arrangements. The turning point came with the introduction of chocolate-covered strawberries, creating a distinct identity for my business. Despite early challenges that nearly led to closure, perseverance paved the way. Celebrating almost 4 years of success, I'm proud of the sweet success built from dedication and resilience. I absolutely love my business. I look forward to creating elegantly designed treats for your next event!"
